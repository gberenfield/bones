My Skeletal Rails App for Rails 3

* merged rails3 branch into master 2010-08-01


******************************************************************************
**																																					**
**		I have created an "AttachmentController/Model/Views" as an example		**
**		of  how to  use everything  in  practice (basic  CRUD stuff). Just		**
**		globally find+remove  all "Attachment" files and references, or you		**
**		may like having some ready-baked attachment handling!									**

RUBY
====

* developed under ruby 1.9.1p378 (2010-01-10 revision 26273)
* 2010-07-09 Finding too many exotic problems and incompatibilities with ruby 1.9.x (1 or 2-preview3 or 2-rc1) with gems breaking/segfaults running back to ruby 1.8.7
* 2010-07-09 rvm install ruby-1.8.7 (2010-06-23 patchlevel 299) 
* 2010-07-30 trying ruby-1.9.2-rc2
* 2010-08-01 still poor ruby-1.9.x support (rcov/cucumber etc. consdier it experimental..). back to ruby-1.8.7-p299


RAILS
=====
3.0.0.rc

TESTING
=======

RCOV works with rspec and cucumber as follows:
cucumber coverage: rake cucumber
rspec coverage: rake rcov

Autotest working with rspec and not cucumber as of 2010-08-01

GEMS
====

* devise (gem)
* jQuery 1.4.2 + plugins  (all manually installed/maintained)
	* jquery-ui 1.8.2
	* jqgrid 3.7.2
	* colorbox 1.3.6

* blueprint css (plugin)
* will_paginate (gem)
* formtastic (gem) # with one necessary override for lwrte!
* paperclip (gem)


GIT / GitHUB
============

mkdir <app_name>
cd <app_name>
	*  rm -r .git (this is to remove bones's git info for github - ok, for me, only ;)
git init
touch README
git add README
git commit -m 'first commit'
git remote add origin git@github.com:gberenfield/<app_name>.git
git push origin master


DATABASE
========

Database starts off with Sqlite3 db   (this is for development, iirc!)

1. sudo bundle install --relock  # to install any missing gems used above!
2. rake db:migrate
2. rake db:seed (loads seed 'admin' account with password 'pass')

      

TESTING NOTES
=============
* for Autotest to work nicely with rspec2 + Bundler, run it with "bundle exec autotest"


DEPLOYMENT
==========
1. need to edit /etc/mongrel_cluster/<app_name>.conf on your deployment location
2. cap deploy:setup
3. cap deploy
4. will need to edit/copy/create <app_name>/shared/config/database.yml file on 
   your deployment location
